# FlashCard-App
A Java program that user can play English-Turkish Flash Card word game. 

Program asks for how many flash card do you want and then gives each flash card one by one and asks for the answer. After you write an answer, if you answered the correct word, it outputs correct answer message but if you answer the wrong word, it shows the correct answer flashcard. 

When the flash cards finish, program gives you your score and also the words that you answered wrong for you to allow you practice those words. Also in that row program shows the difficulty of the words too. If you want to change the language that program asks for, you can use reverseCard method. And if you have any other text file which contains other languages, you can use those too with this program. (I already uploaded the english-turkish words text file for you to test the program.)

I pay attention for program to print out the flashcards in the same format. So, even the word is long or short, the looking of the flashcard doesn't change. 

I would love to see your comments, suggestions and upgrades for this project! Hope you like it.
